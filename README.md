## Usage
Click the "Generate Password" button and then answer the prompts on the screen accordingly. You must choose a password that is between 8 and 128 characters in length. If no length is chosen, or a length that is less than 8, or greater than 128, is chosen, then you will be prompted to choose a valid length. When you have completed all of the prompts, a password will appear on the screen that can be copied to your clipboard.
